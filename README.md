#Assessment: Recipe Box v1
This assessment serves to build familiarity with creating a Django application by making a recipe list. The recipe list will include author details, a description, and recipe instructions.

Intended layout:

An index page that lists all titles of the loaded recipes (they don't have to be real recipes; just fill them with lorem ipsum and some numbers.)
Each title is a link that takes you to a single page with the content of that recipe.
Each detail view for a recipe has the author name.
Clicking on the author's name should take you to an Author Detail page, where you can see a list of all the recipes that Author has contributed to.
Make all of the models accessible by the Admin only.

There will be three types of pages: a simple list view, a recipe detail view, and an author detail view. The admin panel will handle the creation views.
